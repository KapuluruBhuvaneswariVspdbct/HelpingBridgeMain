# Helping Bridge

Helping Bridge is a web application that connects donors with orphanages in need. Donors can easily raise notifications when they have food, clothes, or stationery to donate. The platform then matches donors with the nearest orphanages based on proximity and needs. This solution helps reduce waste and provide essential items to orphanages, improving community welfare.
